      "details":"JavaScript,often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on user's devices.JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).The ECMAScript standard does not include any input/output (I/O), such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities. In practice, the web browser or other runtime system provides JavaScript APIs for I/O.JavaScript engines were originally used only in web browsers, but are now core components of some servers and a variety of applications. The most popular runtime system for this usage is Node.js.Although Java and JavaScript are similar in name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design.",

It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.React adheres to the declarative programming paradigm. Developers design views for each state of an application, and React updates and renders components when data changes. This is in contrast with imperative programming.React code is made of entities called components. These components are reusable and must be formed in the SRC folder following the Pascal Case as its naming convention (capitalize camelCase). Components can be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. When rendering a component, one can pass the values between components through props.",

The core library is focused on the view layer only.Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives.Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in several projects. He later summed up his thought process: I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight. The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014.Version names are often derived from manga and anime, most of which are within the science fiction genre.",
